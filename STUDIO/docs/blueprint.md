## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A cool, vibrant blue (#4681C3) to represent connectivity and reliability. This primary blue conveys trust and modernity, suitable for a tech-related service.
- Background color: A very light blue (#F0F4F8), almost white, creates a clean and open feel.  This provides a non-distracting backdrop.
- Accent color: A warm, contrasting orange (#E07A5F), is used for call-to-action buttons and interactive elements to draw attention and create visual interest. This suggests energy.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean, modern, and readable user interface.
- Use simple, geometric icons to represent different voucher durations (e.g., a calendar icon for daily, a clock for hourly) with the accent color.
- Employ a card-based layout for voucher options, ensuring each option is clearly defined and easily selectable on both desktop and mobile.
- Subtle animations when selecting a voucher or completing a purchase, such as a loading spinner or a smooth transition to the next screen.
